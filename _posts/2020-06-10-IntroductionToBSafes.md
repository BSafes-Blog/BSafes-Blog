How do you store your family’s notes online securely? How do you ensure that notes taken from the board meeting are kept safe and confidential?

The answer, it turns out, lies in open source, multi-platform, and decentralized online notebooks.

Before giving you a better solution, let me back up a minute. 

For a couple of days now, I’ve been having a heated conversation with my spouse about storing out sensitive passwords and other accounts credentials online in a notes app. Online platforms provide us with the capability to access our accounts information while we are both on the go and as well, an easier interface to maneuver through. We need an easy-to-use app that we can view and update while picking up the kids or waiting in line at the bank. 

 Our conversation was something of the sort; 

 “whew can our confidential data be stored securely and still have easy access to it on a daily basis”

“what about our phones or tablets”

“it’s okay, but that would mean that we remind each other of the change in case there is an alteration in our password. And what if the phone gets lost, don’t you think it will be unsafe? May be we can try an online notebook like Google docs or Evernote, or what do you think?”

“uummmm, sure, but you do know those companies have fulltime access to your data, right? “

“yes, I do, but would they? Why would they do that and yet they are there to provide safety for our information that we consider confidential?”

“They most definitely would, and besides, even if they fail to, why risk for such exposure if you value privacy of your information?”

“So what do we use that is private, something that can synchronize on our phones and computers, and won’t be seen by snooping companies?”

Yes, your guess is right, there wasn’t answer for some time and we couldn’t find any reliable app from, what I’d term as a “confidentiality hunt”. We were both tired of searching for sticky notes that had fallen to the floor or physical notebooks that had been left in the wrong car. 

I wanted online tools that only my wife and I could access, and that could be stored and launched from where we chose. A tool that I could customize to not only suit my personal needs but as well cater for my needs at work as a secretary. 

 So I did some research to find perfect match for my needs, a real solution that could guarantee confidentiality and as well serve me with utmost efficiency.  



#### So, why not simply use OneNOte, Google Keep for Work Notes or may be Evernote?

I hear you saying: “Why don’t you just quit complaining and use OneNote, Google Keep, Evernote, Simple note and son and so forth, right? 

Well, it’s because you don’t own the companies that offer those tools nor are you part of them in any way. This means that you can therefore not make the rules and regulations as far as privacy and data protection is concerned. These companies offer a centralized service where all data is stored by them, implying that you are using their tools on their terms.

Sure, you can still use them. Each is a fantastic notes app, and I’ve used many of them for years to capture work notes or collaborate with teams, large or small. But even with global initiatives like GDPR forcing companies to be more transparent, there will always be some level of unwanted access and possible snooping into your data on these tools-whether by humans or intelligent bots.  Most of these apps use a security system known as client server encryption to protect your data. The message is encrypted on your device and decrypted on cloud. The message is encrypted again as it leaves cloud and decrypted again when it gets to your contact’s device.  To worsen the situation, the message doesn’t just go through the cloud storage system, but rather, a log of data sets (your messages) remain there forever. This allows the service provider with unlimited access to your data at their will. Not only that, but a black hat hacker or an indigence agency could as well use the law to coerce a service provider to hand over all your messages. You probably don’t want., and am pretty sure no sane person would also want that. We all need an application that will provide absolute privacy and keep our data secure. The stored notes should be kept secure all the way from your phone, through the cloud and to the targeted device. And this level of security is not achievable with the type of security infrastructure laid by majority of the apps, currently available for note taking. 

For instance, the 2018 Facebook/Cambridge Analytica fiasco proved that a centralized system is not the safest option when it comes to data protection. It showed how vulnerable you and your data are when stored in a single place. 



#### If are after absolute privacy, then go for applications that give you control 

The solution the is to store your data as per your terms. You should also have the ability to control where it is stored, how often the app is updated, who can access it, how you import/export it into other tools.

The best tool to solve our dilemma would therefore be BSafes, a tool used for capturing plaint text work notes.  Bsafes is elegant in its simplicity and can be described as an open source, multiplatform, note-taking tool that has end-to-end encryption, using AES-256, so no one can see the data you store in it. It allows use of a master passcode to lock down on your data an additional security measure to enhance privacy. 

I’ll now give you a brief introduction to BSafes, an epitome of security in note taking apps. 



#### BSafes : AN Open Source Client-Side Encrypted Note Taking App  

BSafes is a note-taking application that puts a particular emphasis on privacy and security. It is a cross-platform and of course, completely open-source. It is a secure note taking web application for teams and individuals, with end-to-end encryption. 



#### A simple BSafes note page

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
 

The core application is free and comes with a free account that synchronizes your data across all the platforms without any limit on the data capacity. (p.s. free during trial period)

A little emphasis about the security part: 

BSafes uses **end-to-end encryption**. This means that, no one except you can read your notes because data conveyed to server is always encrypted.  So, even if a black hat with malicious intentions have access to the servers and thus your data, they will see completely nothing valuable but pure nonsensical gibberish. Your data can only be decrypted when you log into your account, from where you first download them to your PC (while encrypted) and then decryption follows for you. With BSafes, there’s should be no more worries about someone else reading your private notes. 

BSafes is really neat and well-crafted and is definitely worth trying out. To sum up the features, BSafes app offers the following note taking necessities;  

1. **End-to-end encryption with AES 256 bits**
2. **Designed for teams from ground up**
3. **Team collaboration is a dedicated workspace**
4. **Searching nots with encrypted tags.**
5. **Easy to use WYSIWYG rich text editor**
6. **Photos gallery on a note page**
7. **Attaching files on a note page. Each file is up to 500MB, up to 100 files on a page.** 
8. **Version controls** 
9. **Compatible with all modern HTML 5 browsers on Wndows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.** 
10. **Cost effective - $2.99 per month account for unlimited members and teams.** 


#### 256-bit Encryption

Most people see the term 256-bit encryption bundled about all the time and if we are being honest-have absolutely no idea what it means and how strong it is. Once you go beyond the surface-level, “it scrambles data and makes it unreadable,” encryption is an incredibly complicated subject. It’s not a light read. Most of us don’t keep a book about modular exponentiation on the end table beside our beds.

 

A quick refresher on encryption, in general  

When you encrypt something, you are talking the unencrypted data, called plaintext, and performing an algorithmic function on it to create a piece of encrypted ciphertext. The algorithm you are using is called the key. With exception of public keys in asymmetric encryption, the value of the encryption key needs to be kept a secret. The private key associated with that piece of ciphertext is the only practical means of decrypting it.  

2546-bit encryption can therefore be defined as a data/file encryption technique that uses a 256-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data or files. It is one of the most secure encryption methods after 128- and 192- bit encryption and is used in most modern encryption algorithms, protocols and technologies including AES and SSL. 

256-bit encryption refers to the length of the encryption key used to encrypt a data stream or file. A hacker or cracker will require 2256 different combinations to break a 256-bit encrypted message, which is virtually impossible to be broken by even the fastest computers. 

How strong is 256-bit encryption

A low-bit key is one with fewer combinations, so would be fairly easy to crack for a hacker with dedicated computer resources. The larger the key, the harder this becomes, exponentially. For example, a 5-bit key has possible combinations, a 6-bit key has 64 combinations, a 7-bit key has 128 combinations and so forth. The number gets weirdly crazy as you raise the exponential. 

The more complex the encryption, the more difficult it becomes for a cybercriminal to reverse-engineer the encryption key and access the data. This does not mean that the codes are uncrackable, but that the time taken to find the right combination would be far too long to ever be feasible in one lifetime, even with the help of powerful supercomputers.

Let’s say a hacker has a computer that can test a billion keys per second, trying to brute all combinations. That, means they can break a 30-bit key in just one second. At that speed, though, it will take you a billion seconds (or 34 years) to break a 60-bit key because every 30 bits added makes it a billion times more difficult. A spy agency like the NSA can crack 60-bit keys using supercomputers, but a 90-bit key is a billion times more difficult to crack and a 120-bit key would be further billion times more difficult to crack than that. Most applications used by Windows, Android and Apple have at least 128-bit key – the standard encryption algorithm used by US Government for data encryption. 

One can imagine that a 128-bit key, with more than 300, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 key combination, is exceptionally safe. Same goes for 192 or 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard recommended for sensitive data and other valuable information. 

As Bharat Mistry a cybersecurity consultant, puts it into perspective “it would take fifty supercomputers an estimated 3.4 x 1, 038 years to break the commonly used 256-bit encryption key.” And with this type of cyber defence in place, BSafes is quite condifident in selling tis app as the most security efficient in the market. As you can imagine, most hackers will be hard pressed to find time to access you notes.
