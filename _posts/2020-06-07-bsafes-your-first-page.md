Since you are a new user, you will have to sign up for the application first. To do that, you can either use email, Facebook, or Google. We will first look into email sign-up, and after that, Facebook sign-up. Google sign-up is similiar.

#### 3.1. Email Sign Up: 
To sign up using email, press the Blue highlighted Sign Up button, which is in the image below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-1.png"
     alt="BSafes Sign In"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After pressing the Sign Up button, you would see the sign-up page shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-2.png"
     alt=" Email Sign Up"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Now to register, the first thing you must do is enter our email like this:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-3.png"
     alt="Enter Your Email"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After successfully entering the email, press the start button. From there, you would see the verification page where we enter the verification code received on your valid email address. The below image shows a screenshot of a verification code page.

     alt="Enter Verfication Code"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Now we open the email received from BSafes like the one shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-5.png"
     alt="Check Your Email"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 

Next, we enter the code received in the email into the verification code page. Enter the correct code and click on the blue verify button, as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-6.png"
     alt="Enter Verfication Code"

If you entered the valid code, you would see a page to set the Name and Password. Here you enter the desired name and password, as shown below, and then click on send:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-7.png"
     alt="Name and Password"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After selecting the name and the password, you would see the crucial key-creation screen to create your secret key.  Your device uses the key to encrypt and decrypt everything you save on the BSafes workspace. Your device never sends the key to the BSafes server, and it is your responsibility to remember it. In the key-creation screen, you must type and retype the key and set any optional hint, as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-8.png"
     alt="Create Your Key"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

First, enter the key in the Create-Your-Key field and enter the same key in the Confirm-Your-Key field. When you enter the key second time correctly, You would see a pop-up that alerts you always to remember your secret key, as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-9.png"
     alt="Remember Your Key"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After pressing OK on the pop-up, you are back on the key-creation screen again. You have the option to set a hint for the key if you want; otherwise, you can leave it and click on done.

     alt="Confirm Your Key"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After successful registration, you would see the first Welcome screen, which prompts you to enter your secret key, as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-1-11.png"
     alt="Enter Your Key"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

If you enter the key successfully, you will be taken to the workspace page as shown below:

     alt="Your Personal Space"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

#### 3.2. Facebook Sign Up:
You can also sign up using Facebook if you do not want to enter your email every time. To sign up using Facebook, you go to the Sign-In page, as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-2-1.png"
     alt="BSafes Sign In"

Next, you press the blue Facebook button shown above. By clicking the Facebook button, you would see the Facebook confirmation page to give BSafes access to your allowed Facebook user data so that we can sign up, as shown below:

Now when you press continue, you get prompt to create our secret key page as it was with email, as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-2-3.png"
     alt="Create Your Key"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Like before with email sign-up, you enter and confirm the key and set an optional hint. After that, press Done, and you would see the Welcome screen, as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_3-2-4.png"
     alt="Enter Your Key"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

You enter your secret key on the Welcome page correctly to access the workspace screen shown below:

     alt="Your Personal Space"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

#### 4. Create first Page in Personal workspace:
Each member has his or her own Personal Space, where you can add or create multiple things. Everything you add or write is encrypted and secure such that no one else could access it. It gives an extra layer of security to your data along with storage on the cloud. 
 
To create a personal page, first sign in to BSafes, select your Personal Workspace by clicking the "Personal" Option shown in the below screen:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_4-1.png"
     alt="BSafes Workspaces"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After clicking the "Personal" option, you will enter into your Personal Workspace; click on "+" to begin adding items! Your device encrypts your data before sending it to the cloud:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_4-2.png"
     alt="Your Personal Space"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

You will get the following screen, which shows that you can have multiple options. You can create Page, Notebook, Diary, Box, and Folder. Whenever you save your writing or upload photos, videos, or any files, your device encrypts everything automatically. Now you are going to create your first page, for that, click on the "page" option:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_4-3.png"
     alt="Select a Type"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

You will get a Title pop-up. Then type the title of the page and click create:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_4-4.png"
     alt="Enter the Title"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

You would see your first page created and displayed, as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_4-5.png"
     alt="Your First Page"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Now you could start writing, add photos, videos, and attach files. And you could add tags on top of a page for easy search.
