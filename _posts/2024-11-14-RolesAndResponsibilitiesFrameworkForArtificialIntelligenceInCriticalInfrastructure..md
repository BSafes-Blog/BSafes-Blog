Key points include:
•  Five Key Roles: The framework addresses the responsibilities of cloud and compute infrastructure providers, AI developers, critical infrastructure owners and operators, civil society, and the public sector.

•  Voluntary Responsibilities: It outlines voluntary guidelines for AI use, focusing on safe practices and risk management.

•  Collaboration: Developed with input from industry, academia, civil society, and public sector representatives, ensuring practical and implementable guidance.

This framework aims to enhance the resilience and security of critical services while minimizing potential risks associated with AI deployment.
