After setting the name and the password we are taken to the most important screen. The secret key screen, this is where we set our private key which will be used to encrypt and decrypt everything, we save on the BSafes workspace. This key is never stored on BSafes server and it is your responsibility to always remember it. In the secret key screen, we must type and retype the key and set any optional hint.
