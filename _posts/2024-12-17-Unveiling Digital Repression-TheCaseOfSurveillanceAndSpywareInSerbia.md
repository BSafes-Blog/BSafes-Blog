In February 2024, independent journalist Slaviša Milanov from Dimitrovgrad, Serbia, experienced an alarming incident during a traffic stop where he was taken to a police station. After his release, Slaviša noticed his phone, left at the police reception at the officers' request, was malfunctioning – data and Wi-Fi settings were disabled. Concerned about potential hacking, he contacted Amnesty International's Security Lab for assistance.

The subsequent [analysis](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur70/8813/2024/en/) revealed two significant findings. First, forensic evidence indicated that somebody had used a [Cellebrite tool](/Balancing-Justice-and-PrivacyBalancingJusticeAndPrivacyTheEthicalImplicationsOfDigitalForensicsTools/) to unlock Slaviša's phone without his consent or any legal justification, raising serious concerns about unauthorized surveillance targeting journalists. Given the oppressive environment for free press in Serbia, this incident highlighted the risks faced by media professionals.

Secondly, the analysis uncovered traces of new spyware named NoviSpy, which can capture sensitive data and remotely activate the phone's microphone or camera. While under police control, authorities installed spyware on Slaviša's device, indicating a coordinated effort to violate his digital privacy.

[Amnesty International's research](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur70/8813/2024/en/) further exposed widespread digital surveillance in Serbia, involving the use of various spyware and Cellebrite technology to monitor activists, journalists, and civil society organizations. The findings illustrated a troubling pattern of state-sponsored repression, with authorities abusing these surveillance tools against peaceful protestors and dissenters.

The report drew attention to the pervasive atmosphere of intimidation within Serbia, particularly following increasing anti-government protests since 2021, leading to severe crackdowns on civil society. Amnesty's revealing investigation combined testimonies from those targeted by these technologies with forensic data to expose the broader implications of state surveillance.

Serbia's legal framework governing digital surveillance needs to be revised. Multiple activists reported feeling vulnerable and altering their communication practices due to the fear of being monitored, demonstrating the chilling effect of such invasive surveillance on free expression and civil engagement.

Overall, this situation underscores the urgent need for reform and accountability in Serbia regarding digital surveillance practices, emphasizing the responsibility of both the state and technology providers like Cellebrite to safeguard human rights. The report calls for immediate action to halt the misuse of surveillance technologies and ensure the protection of civil liberties in Serbia.
