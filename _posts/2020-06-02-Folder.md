After selecting the folder, you must enter a folder name as shown below and press Create.

After creating a folder, you would see the folder cover page, as shown below. Here you can edit the title, add tags, or open the folder to start adding pages.

Now let's start working inside the folder. For this, click the Open button shown on the right side of the folder.

After clicking the open button, you would see the contents page, as shown below.

Create your first page inside a folder, press the blue plus icon, and select page from the prompt shown below.

After clicking on the Page option, you would see a prompt to enter the page title. Enter the title and press create to create the page inside the folder, as shown below.

If you click either option, you will see a prompt to enter the new page's name, as shown below.

Similarly, as you created the first page, you will enter the name of your choice and press Create to add the second page.

Now, if you want to view all the pages, click the bullets icon on the top left of the black bar, as shown below.

You will see all pages, as shown below.

     alt="Folder Contents"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

To create additional pages in the folder relative to the previous pages, click the plus sign on the right side of the page's name. Like before, you can set its location before or after the selected page, as shown below.

Similar to other item types, you can search contents in folders in two ways. The first way is to search inside the folder by clicking the search icon on the top black search bar's right, as shown below.
