In a landmark operation, INTERPOL has announced the arrest of over 5,500 suspects and the seizure of assets worth more than USD 400 million. This global effort, known as Operation HAECHI V, targeted a wide range of cyber-enabled financial crimes, including voice phishing, romance scams, and illegal online gambling.

INTERPOL Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza emphasized the significance of international cooperation in combating cybercrime: "The borderless nature of cybercrime means international police cooperation is essential, and the success of this operation supported by INTERPOL shows what results can be achieved when countries work together."

The operation, which spanned five continents and involved law enforcement from 40 countries, highlights the growing threat of cyber-enabled fraud and the importance of coordinated global efforts to tackle it. Urquiza added, "Itâ€™s only through united efforts that we can make the real and digital worlds safer."
