The community's feedback indicates an apparent demand for transparency and accountability in technology, with users eager to choose products that align with their ethical values.

On average, respondents demonstrated reasonable confidence in their understanding of AI, but a collective urge remains to explore its implications further. The top three concerns voiced included:
