#### 8. Add a member 
The Account owner could add members to an account. Once a member completes his or her key-creation step, he or she has a dedicated workspace. Then a member can join or create other teams. To add a member, click on the top right corner where you see your initial; and then click Members.

#### 9. Add a Team:
Similarly, like a personal workspace, there’s a team workspace where members can collaborate and can have the option or facility to work mutually. Any member could create teams and invite other members to join. Once you login to BSafes, you get a Teams page. Click “+” to add a new one.
