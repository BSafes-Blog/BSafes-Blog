#### 11.4. Box
Now we will move on to how a box works. As a folder could contain only pages, a box can contain any time of item like notebooks diaries, folders, and even boxes.

To create a box we simply go to the activities tab, click on the blue plus sign and select box as shown below:

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Next we set the name of the box as desired as click create.

After successfully creating a box we are taken to the box main page where we can edit the title, add tags or open the box as shown below:

     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

When we click open we are taken to the box content page to view all items inside the box as we can see below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-4-4.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

To add an item to the box we click the blue plus sign and select any item we want to create from the menu shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-4-5.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

As we can see we can add any item inside the box that we want, there is also a new type of item photos, using this we can directly add photos to the box.

We can create items from box like we did for the page, notebooks, folders and diary. The only difference is that instead of going to the main activity tab these new items will be created inside the box. In the figure below we have created two items inside our box:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-4-6.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Similar as it was with other item types, box items can be searched through tags or titles inside the box or via the main search option on the activity tab. One important thing to know is that items within items cannot be searched with the box search and they must be searched via the main search.

To illustrate this we have a box that contains a page with a tag “boxtag” and notebook that has a page inside it with a tag “boxtag”. Now when we search the word boxtag via the box search we will only see the page in the result as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-4-7.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-4-8.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Now if we search the same tag from the main search we will get the following result.

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-4-9.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-4-10.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Now when we entered the word “boxtag” we got the page as well as the page inside the notebook in the result. So we have to remember this limitation of a box while searching for items inside it.

#### 12. Conclusion
In this tutorial we have looked what BSafes is and how to use it. We started with signup for the application and then moving on to creating our first page. We looked at how parts of pages work and what unique features they have. After that we looked into creating teams, by adding team members and assigning team members in a team workspace. In the end we looked at how we can organize data efficiently using notebooks, diaries, folders, and boxes. We saw how each of these features work and how to search specific data easily using the search feature. Along with all these features its most important features was end-end encryption that ensure the data security.  In the future we would discuss further on team collaboration for the ease of team working in more efficient way.
