#### 11.  Organizing and searching notes with Notebooks, Diaries, Folders, and Boxes
BSafes provide us with multiple ways to add and store content. These are pages, notebooks, diaries, folders and boxes. To understand how notes are stored in notebooks, diaries, folders and boxes, we first have to understand the most basic note that is saved on BSafes and that is called a page.â€¨We previously discussed page in our create a page section.

Since we know how a page is created and used we can start understanding notebooks ,diaries, folders, and boxes.

#### 11.1. Notebook
A **notebook** is simply a space that can have multiple pages. Pages in a notebook are ordered by page numbers. To select notebook simply click on notebook when you press the blue plus sign in the activities tab as shown below:

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 

You will be prompt to select a name for your notebook. After choosing and entering an appropriate name press create as shown below:

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

This will take you to the first page of the notebook as shown below:

     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Here we can enter the data we want to insert into the page. Now if we want to add another page into our notebook we can simply press the black arrow on the white box on the right side to take us to the next page, as shown below.

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

We can clearly see in the right side of the top black bar that our page number has changed from 1 to 2. Similar to this, we can add more pages to our notebook.

To view all the pages in our notebook we can press the bullets icon on the top left corner of the black bars as shown below:

     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

This wil take us to a new page where all pages will be displayed by title. From here we can navigate to any desired page easily.

To make the data in the notebook searchable tags can be added. Tags can be added to each individual page or the main notebook page. To add tags on pages we simply open a page and type next to the tag icon on the top left of the page as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-1-7.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After entering our desired tag we simply press enter and the tag is added and the application allows us to enter the next tag if we want.

Now we can also add tags to the main notebook cover page, to do that we go the notebook cover my clicking the notebook icon on the top left of the black bar as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-1-9.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

This takes us to the notebook cover page as shown below:

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-1-10.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Here we can edit the notebook title, open the notebook by clicking the open button and enter tags by typing our desired tag in the plus sign next to the tag icon on the top left of the notebook.

Similarly we can add multiple tags as desired.


Now we can easily search our notebook by using either tags or title names. Search can be done on the main personal or teams workspace by typing inside the search field as shown below:

Or we can specifically search inside the notebook if we only want to get data from the notebook as shown below. After entering the text inside the highlighted field we just press the search icon:
