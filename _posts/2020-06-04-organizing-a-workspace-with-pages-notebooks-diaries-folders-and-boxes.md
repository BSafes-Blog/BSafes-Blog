#### 11.  Organizing and searching notes with Notebooks, Diaries, Folders, and Boxes
BSafes provides multiple ways to add and store content. These are pages, notebooks, diaries, folders, and boxes. To understand how you can keep contents organized, you first must understand the essential item type saved on BSafes, called a page. We previously discussed the page in our create a page section.

Since you know how a page is created and used, you can start understanding notebooks, diaries, folders, and boxes.

#### 11.1. Notebook
A notebook is simply a collection of pages ordered by page numbers. To select a notebook, click on the Notebook when you press the blue plus sign in the activities tab, as shown below.

     alt="Add a Notebook"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 

You will be prompt to select a title for your Notebook. After choosing and entering an appropriate name, press Create, as shown below.

     alt="Notebook Title"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

It will take you to the first page of the Notebook, as shown below.

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-1-3_v2.png"
     alt="First Page"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Here you can add content to the page. Now, if you're going to add another page, you can press the black arrow on the white box on the right side to take you to the next page, as shown below.

     alt="Next Page"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

You can see the page number on the top black bar's right side has changed from 1 to 2. Similar to this, you can add more pages to the Notebook. You can also go to a specific page by entering a page number on the top black bar's right side and select the right arrow.

To view all the pages in a Notebook, you can press the bullets icon on the black bars' top left corner, as shown below.

     alt="Go to Contents"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

It will take you to a Contents page listing all pages by title. From here, you can navigate to any desired page easily.

     alt="Contents"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Tags make the content in the Notebook searchable. You can add tags to each page or the notebook Cover page. To add tags to a page, go to a specific page, type on the top left of the page, as shown below.

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-1-7_v2.png"
     alt="Page Tag"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

After entering the desired tag,  press Enter, and the application allows you to enter the next one if you want. After entering all tags, click the "âœ“" button to save.

     alt="Save Tags"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Now you can also add tags to the notebook Cover page. To do that, go the Notebook cover by clicking the notebook icon on the top left of the black bar, as shown below.

     alt="Go to Cover"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

It takes you to the notebook cover page, as shown below.

<img src="https://statics.bsafes.com/images/Tutorial_11-1-10_v2.png"
     alt="Cover"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

You can edit the notebook title, open the Notebook by clicking the open button and enter tags by typing the desired tag in the plus sign next to the tag icon on the top left of the Notebook.

     alt="Cover Tag"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Similarly, you can add multiple tags as desired.

Now you can effortlessly search our Notebook by using either tags or title names(the app breaks down the title into tokens for searching). You can search in a workspace by typing inside the search field, as shown below.

     alt="Search in a Workspace"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Or you can specifically search inside the Notebook if you only want to get content from the Notebook, as shown below. After pressing the search button, enter the text, then search.

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
