Taiwan's cyberspace has repeatedly been subjected to attacks, data theft, and disruptions by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cyber forces. Their methods are continually evolving, targeting a wide range of entities, including government institutions, critical infrastructure, and high-tech manufacturing industries. These actions aim to disrupt government operations and extract political, military, technological, and economic advantages.

## I. Trend Development
### 1. Overview of Threat Trends:
According to the government's internet service "Indicators of Compromise" (IoCs) statistics, the average daily intrusion attempts on Taiwan's government internet services in 2024 reached 2.4 million, more than doubling the 1.2 million daily average in 2023 (see Figure 1). The majority of these intrusions were attributed to CCP cyber forces. While most attempts were effectively detected and blocked, the overall trend underscores an increasingly severe state of cyber disruptions.

### 2. Targets of Cyber Intrusions:
In 2024, Taiwan's national security intelligence teams identified 906 cyber intrusion cases involving both government and private sectors, reflecting a growth of over 20% compared to 752 cases in 2023. Government agencies were the most affected, accounting for over 80% of the cases.
Further analysis of CCP cyberattack targets reveals significant growth in the following sectors: telecommunications (650%, primarily targeting telecom operators), transportation (70%), and the national defense supply chain (57%). These sectors have become emerging focal points for CCP cyberattacks (see Figure 2).

## II. Cyber Intrusion Methods
### 1. Targeting Government Departments:
The CCP cyber forces exploited vulnerabilities in government agencies' network communication equipment to plant backdoors and steal data. Using "Living off-the-land" (LotL) techniques, they evaded detection by cybersecurity systems. For example, they exploited email server vulnerabilities to launch intrusions against government agencies. Additionally, they conducted social engineering attacks targeting the email accounts of public officials, attempting to steal sensitive information.

### 2. Targeting IT Service Providers and the National Defense Supply Chain:
The CCP cyber forces employed diverse tactics to infiltrate and steal data from Taiwan's IT service providers and national defense supply chain. They focused on vendors managing email systems, document management platforms, password generation tools, and personnel scheduling systems. Furthermore, the scope of their attacks has significantly expanded.

### 3. Targeting Critical Infrastructure:
The CCP cyber forces utilized advanced persistent threats (APTs), phishing emails, zero-day vulnerabilities, Trojan viruses, and backdoor programs to infiltrate and compromise critical infrastructure. Their efforts focused on sectors such as highways and port operations, aiming to disrupt Taiwan's transportation and logistics systems.

### 4. Employing Military-Civil Fusion Tactics:
The CCP combined efforts with civilian hacker organizations to carry out cyberattacks on Taiwan's manufacturing companies, using methods such as ransomware to extract economic benefits. Recent investigations by the Criminal Investigation Bureau revealed CCP intrusions into academic and research institutions, where they engaged in activities like password cracking and modifying landline system settings to enable outgoing calls, which were then used for telephone fraud schemes.

### 5. Utilizing Cyber Anonymity and Dark Web Exposure:
The CCP employed cyberattacks to steal personal data from Taiwan, which they then disclosed or sold on the dark web and hacker forums for profit, executing a "Hack & Leak" strategy. Simultaneously, they leveraged social media and online forums to post criticisms of Taiwan's cybersecurity capabilities, aiming to undermine public trust and erode national credibility.

### 6. Coordinating Military Drills with Cyber Disruptions:
During military drills targeting Taiwan, the CCP cyber forces synchronized cyberattack operations, deploying tactics such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks targeted critical infrastructure, including transportation and financial systems, leveraging edge network devices. The objective was to amplify disruptive effects and enhance military intimidation.

### 7. Targeting Innovative Industries to Steal Technology:
The CCP has also targeted high-tech startups worldwide to steal patented technologies for competitive advantage. In 2020, Cisco issued a warning about a CCP hacker group (APT41) exploiting vulnerabilities in products from well-known network equipment companies such as Citrix and Cisco. These attacks targeted global enterprises to steal sensitive internal technological information.

### 8. Building a Global Anonymous Cyberattack Network:
The CCP exploited password vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices to launch cyberattacks, taking control of these devices and encrypting them in a chain-like fashion. It allowed them to build an anonymous network, often called a botnet, to carry out cyberattack activities.

## Conclusion:
The CCP continues to intensify its cyberattacks on Taiwan, employing a range of diverse cyber intrusion tactics to target the government, critical infrastructure, and key private enterprises for espionage and data theft. Through its cybersecurity defense mechanisms, the Taiwanese government utilizes multiple intelligence channels to gather and share cyber threat warnings with the relevant authorities for immediate action. Additionally, the public is urged to prioritize cybersecurity and remain vigilant against the CCP's cyber threats, working together to safeguard the nation's cybersecurity.
