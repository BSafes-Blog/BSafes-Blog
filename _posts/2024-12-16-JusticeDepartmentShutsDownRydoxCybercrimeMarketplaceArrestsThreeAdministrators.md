The U.S. Department of Justice announced the successful [takedown of Rydox](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/rydox-cybercrime-marketplace-shut-down-and-three-administrators-arrested), a notorious cybercrime marketplace, and the arrest of its three administrators. The Rydox platform, which facilitated the sale of stolen personal information, access devices, and various cybercrime tools, has been dismantled in a coordinated effort involving domestic and international law enforcement agencies.

"The indictment alleges that, for more than eight years, the defendants administered an illicit online marketplace that sold PII, credit card information, and login credentials that bad actors had stolen from thousands of U.S. victims," said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. "Today, we announce that working with our domestic and foreign law enforcement partners, we have dismantled the marketplace, arrested its administrators, and seized their criminal proceeds. This announcement is a powerful demonstration of the value of our partnerships on cybercrime, without which these arrests and seizures would not have been possible."

U.S. Attorney Eric G. Olshan for the Western District of Pennsylvania added, "The Rydox marketplace was a one-stop shop where upwards of 18,000 of its cybercriminal customers could choose from more than 300,000 cybercrime tools. While cybercrime often involves conduct occurring overseas and the actions of foreign nationals, its harms can be devastatingly local, with residents in our own communities suffering financial ruin as a result of the theft and misuse of their sensitive personal information."
